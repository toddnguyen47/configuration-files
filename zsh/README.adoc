Simply run `./install.sh` and you're good to go!

== Add an override to `ZSH_THEME`

To have a possible override, add the following to your `.zshrc`

[source, shell]
----
if [[ -n ${ZSH_THEME_OVERRIDE} ]]; then
    ZSH_THEME="${ZSH_THEME_OVERRIDE}"
else
    ZSH_THEME="random"
fi
----

To use the above code, type these commands into your terminal:

[source, shell]
----
# Use your choice of theme to replace `zx-exit-status`
export ZSH_THEME_OVERRIDE="zx-exit-status"
source ~/.zshrc
----
